The applications of Shewhart control charts are limitless, and the analytical methodology of Statistical Process Control (SPC) remains innovative.

"There is no substitute for knowledge. But the prospect of using knowledge is frightening."

Understanding the theory of variability and applying Shewhart control charts at all levels of company management is, without exaggeration, of utmost importance for the competitiveness of Russian industry.

The use of Shewhart control charts allows for the identification of production problems as soon as they arise and enables proper responses to them, avoiding first and second kind errors before they lead to defects and rework.

Shewhart control charts are indispensable for improving business processes, the quality of produced goods and services, and enhancing employee efficiency, operating at a new level of decision-making effectiveness that was previously inaccessible—without new equipment and without new personnel¹. The open solutions and articles presented on our website aim to highlight just a few examples of such solutions.

¹See one of the examples in the open solution "[New Machines, Robotization, and Devices – Not a Panacea!](https://en.advanced-quality-tools.ru/robotization-and-digitalization.html)"
and one of the explanations in the article "[Right and Wrong Ways to Use Specifications. Sorting or Adjusting?"](https://enadvanced-quality-tools.ru/right-and-wrong-ways-to-use-specifications-djw.html)"

Shewhart control charts are the primary analytical tool of Statistical Process Control (SPC) and are successfully applied in industry, trade, service sectors, healthcare, sports, education, environmental monitoring, insurance, security, government administration, and space (see examples below).

The innovativeness of the Shewhart control chart methodology is further confirmed by the fact that even those familiar with control charts often have not had the opportunity to use them to their full potential.

For analyzing business and technological processes using Shewhart control charts, any measurement and counting data will suffice, for example:
Data on controlling key quality characteristics of in-house semi-finished products and finished goods;
Data on controlling key quality characteristics of services provided;
Incoming control data for materials;
Any key performance indicators (design, procurement, production, sales, maintenance, warehousing, logistics, etc.);
Frequency of events (incidents, accidents), any counting data (defects, breakdowns, unplanned downtimes, etc.);
Predictive analytics data (controlled parameters of expensive and critical equipment operation);
Data on size, weight, gap, consumption, liquid level, vibration (vibrodiagnostics), pressure, temperature, humidity, gas analysis, position, speed, force, viscosity, density, hardness, radioactivity, illumination, dustiness, concentration, presence and quantity of impurities, tribodiagnostics, acidity, contamination, acoustic measurements, electrical measurements, and other measurements.
